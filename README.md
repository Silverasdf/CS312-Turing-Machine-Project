# CS312-Turing-Machine-Project

This was a project for my CS312 class. The goal was to create a Turing Machine that implement several C/C++ Context-Free Grammar Rules with a Turing Machine Simulator.

## Getting Started

First, to get the TM simulator we used, you must go here, and follow the instructions provided: <https://github.com/andreicozma1/STEM/releases/tag/v2.0.1>

Then, open the TM simulator and load the Turing Machine txt file provided in this repository.

After that, you can edit the tape and run the TM with the buttons provided. See documentation for more details on the input.

## Details of the files

### Documentation

This was the documentation we had to submit with the project. This explains much more in depth what the project is about and how it works.

### Tex File

This is the tex file that was used to create the documentation.

### Turing Machine txt file

This is the Turing Machine file that was used to run the Turing Machine Simulator.

### TM Screenshot

This is a screenshot of the Turing Machine Simulator running the Turing Machine. This was needed in the documentation.
